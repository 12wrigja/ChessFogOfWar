# Chess: Fog of War

A chess game with the adaption of Fog of War. You can only see the spaces on the gameboard that are moveable by your pieces. This creates for a completely different playing strategy than the original chess game. Developed in 3D to add an additional visual appeal. Open-source, feel free to collaborate!

##Development Screenshots
April 11, 2015: Very early in development. No unique pieces or sides. Currently getting the classes established for sides (player and opponent). Spaces were removed to be as an example of how the game will just be missing spaces to act as the fog since that space is not visible.
